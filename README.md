<h1>Insights on algorithmic fairness leveraging state-of-the-art explanation methods</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Understanding and interpreting machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes applications, is critical for ensuring
fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness. This paper explores various counterfactual explanation methodologies and their
application to benchmark datasets. We review three prominent techniques: DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations),
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). These methodologies
are evaluated on two widely used datasets: the COMPAS dataset, which predicts recidivism risk, and the Adult dataset,
which forecasts income levels. Our results provide insights into how well these methods perform in explaining model
decisions, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. The findings offer practical guidance for selecting appropriate
explanation techniques based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the application. This paper
contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models and ensure their responsible use
in decision-making processes.
